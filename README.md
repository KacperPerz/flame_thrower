# How does it work?

Flame thrower is an Arduino Uno controlled project using Adafruit's LIS3DH motion sensor. The device consists of a small gas tank with an electro-valve, a lighter, a battery, a prototype board with a circuit. Gas is loaded into the tank, I use propane butane in the form of lighter gas. The plasma lighter connected to the rest of the system lights up when the punch is executed, and with it, the solenoid valve opens, through which the compressed gas comes out. The gas ignites meeting an arc of plasma from the lighter generating a flame.
